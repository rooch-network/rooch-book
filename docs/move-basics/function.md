# Function

Functions are the building blocks of Move programs. They are called from
user transactions and from other functions, grouping executable
code into reusable units. Functions can take arguments and return values. They are declared with
the `fun` keyword at the module level. By default, functions are private and can only be accessed
from within the module.

```move
module book::math {
    /// This function takes two arguments of type `u64` and returns their sum.
    /// The `public` visibility modifier makes the function accessible from
    /// outside the module.
    public fun add(a: u64, b: u64): u64 {
        a + b
    }

    #[test]
    fun test_add() {
        let sum = add(1, 2);
        assert!(sum == 3, 0);
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a function `add` that takes two arguments of type `u64` and returns their
sum. The function is called from the `test_add` function, which is a test function located in the
same module. In the test, we compare the result of the `add` function with the expected value and
abort the execution if the result is different.

## Function Declaration

> Functions in Move follow the `snake_case` naming convention. This means
> that the function name should be all lowercase with words separated by underscores. For example,
> `do_something`, `add`, `get_balance`, `is_authorized`, and so on.

A function is declared with the `fun` keyword followed by the function name (a valid Move
identifier), a list of arguments in parentheses, and a return type. The function body is a block of
code that contains a sequence of statements and expressions. The last expression in the function
body is the return value of the function.

```move
fun return_nothing() {
    // empty expression, function returns `()`
}
```

## Accessing Functions

Just like any other module member, functions can be imported and accessed via a path. The path
consists of the module path and the function name separated by `::`. For example, if you have a
function called `add` in the `math` module in the `book` package, the path to it will be
`book::math::add`, or, if the module is imported, `math::add`.

```move
module book::use_math {
    use book::math;

    fun call_add() {
        // function is called via the path
        let sum = math::add(1, 2);
    }
}
```

## Multiple Return Values

Move functions can return multiple values, which is useful when you need to return more than one
value from a function. The return type of the function is a tuple of types. The return value is a
tuple of expressions.

```move
fun get_name_and_age(): (vector<u8>, u8) {
    (b"John", 25)
}
```

The result of a function call with a tuple return has to be unpacked into variables via `let (tuple)`
syntax:

```move
// Tuple must be destructured to access its elements.
// Name and age are declared as immutable variables.
let (name, age) = get_name_and_age();
assert!(name == b"John", 0);
assert!(age == 25, 0);
```

If any of the declared values need to be mutable, the `mut` keyword is placed before the
variable name:

```move
// declare name as mutable, age as immutable
let (mut name, age) = get_name_and_age();
```

If some of the arguments are not used, they can be ignored with the `_` symbol:

```move
// ignore the name, only use the age
let (_, age) = get_name_and_age();
```
